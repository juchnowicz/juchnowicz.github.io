title: "About Me"
---

Hello and welcome to this website where I share my journey into the world of Data Science!<br>I've spent the last 9 years of my career at Deloitte US as a software engineer and project manager working on process automation, data pipelines and tax software implementation for high-profile, corporate clients. Before that, I worked at a telecom regulatroy agency in Poland, developing infrastructure databases and performing market analyses around competitiveness and service quality. My educational background includes a major in MIS and Economics.<br>Since the beginning of 2024, I devoted most of my time to developing my Data Science skills. So far, I completed an Applied Data Science Program at MIT, obtained 3 new certificates and started working on projects that you can explore in my [Projects]({% link _pages/portfolio.md %}) section. My current career aspiration is to find a role in Data Science where I can work on challenging initiatives and continue learning.<br>Outside of work, I’m really into fencing, running, investing and travel hacking. My personal goal is to run a marathon in every country I visit — because why not combine my passion for travel with a bit of a challenge?
