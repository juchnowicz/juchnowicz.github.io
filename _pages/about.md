title: "About Me"
---

Hello and welcome to this website where I share my journey into the world of Data Science!<br>I've spent the last 9 years of my career at Deloitte US as a software engineer and project manager working on process automation, data pipelines and tax software implementation for high-profile, corporate clients. Prior to that, I worked at a telecom regulatroy agency in Poland, where I developed infrastructure databases and conducted market analyses on competitiveness and service quality. My educational background includes a major in MIS and Economics. You can see my full resume [here.]({{ site.url }}/assets/documents/MarcinJuchnowicz-Resume_07162024.pdf){:target="_blank"}<br>Since the beginning of 2024, I devoted most of my time to developing my Data Science skills. So far, I completed an Applied Data Science Program at MIT, obtained several new certifications and started working on projects that you can explore in my [Projects section]({% link _pages/portfolio.md %}). My current career aspiration is to find a role in Data Science where I can tackle challenging initiatives and continue growing my skillset.<br>Outside of work, I’m practice fencing, running, investing and travel hacking. My personal goal is to run a marathon in every country I visit — because why not combine my passion for travel with a bit of a challenge?
