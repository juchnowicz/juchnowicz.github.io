As part of the MIT Applied Data Science Program (ADSP), I completed several hands-on projects. These projects allowed me to apply a range of data science techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, machine learning algorithms (including decision trees, regression, ensemble models, time series models, neural networks and recommendation systems). Visit my e-portfolio below to view summaries of these projects and the applied methodologies.
